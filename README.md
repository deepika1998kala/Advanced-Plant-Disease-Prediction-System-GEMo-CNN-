# Advanced-Plant-Disease-Prediction-System-GEMo-CNN-

This project implements a multi-task deep learning system for joint plant species and disease prediction using a shared CNN backbone (GEMo CNN). The model leverages shared feature extraction with task-specific classification heads to improve generalization across tasks.

Regularization and data augmentation techniques are applied to reduce overfitting. The system achieves 95.1% accuracy in plant species classification and 96.8% accuracy in disease detection across multiple classes.
